**FULL SPEED. NO BRAKES. A wallet built by the people, for the people.**

AntiCoinBase Wallet is a **decentralized, open-source** Bitcoin wallet designed to **reject Bech32 (SegWit)** addresses and support only **Legacy** (`1...`) and **P2SH** (`3...`) formats. This wallet exists for those who demand control, privacy, and true peer-to-peer value exchange—no intermediaries, no compromise.

## Features

- Supports **Legacy** and **P2SH** Bitcoin address formats
- **Rejects Bech32 / SegWit** formats for maximum backwards compatibility

## Why AntiCoinBase?

Coinbase and other centralized exchanges have compromised the spirit of Bitcoin. This project is a protest—a declaration of **sovereign digital independence**. We don't want tracking, KYC surveillance, or forced standards. We want raw crypto. This is the **resistance chain**.
